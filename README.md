### Extensions (22 total)

All extensions live in `dotfiles/extensions/` and are symlinked into
`~/.pi/agent/extensions/` by the installer.

**Safety and workflow:**

| Extension | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `damage-control/` | Safety guardrail engine: blocks destructive commands, enforces path access rules, prevents accidental deletes |
| `commit-approval.ts` | Intercepts git commits for interactive review before execution |
| `pr-approval.ts` | Intercepts PR creation for interactive review |
| `dirty-repo-guard.ts` | Warns when working in a repo with uncommitted changes |

**Search and tools:**

| Extension | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `exa-search-tool.ts` | Registers Exa as a semantic web search tool |
| `exa-enforce.ts` | Enforces Exa over ad-hoc web search methods |
| `tilldone.ts` | Task list management with progress tracking |
| `tools.ts` | Custom tool registrations |

**UI and session management:**

| Extension | What it does |
|-----------|-------------|
| `btw.ts` | Overlay chat panel with scroll support |
| `control.ts` | Session control and summarization |
| `loop.ts` | Loop execution with breakout conditions |
| `context.ts` | TUI showing loaded extensions, skills, token usage |
| `files.ts` | File picker with quick actions (reveal, open, edit, diff) |
| `review.ts` | Code review: PR review, branch diffs, uncommitted changes |
| `session-breakdown.ts` | Session cost/usage analytics with calendar heatmap |
| `todos.ts` | File-based todo management |
| `term-notify.ts` | Desktop notifications on agent completion (cmux + OSC 777) |
| `qna-interactive.ts` | Structured Q&A mode |
| `question-mode.ts` | Read-only question mode (no file changes) |
| `require-session-name-on-exit.ts` | Prompts for session name before exit |
| `execute-command/` | Slash command execution |
| `uv.ts` | Intercepts pip/python calls and redirects to uv |

### MCP Servers

Configured in `mcp.json` (created from template during install). These
are the MCP servers this setup uses:

| Server | Purpose | Source |
|--------|---------|--------|
| [jCodeMunch](https://github.com/jcodemunch/jcodemunch-mcp) | Code indexing, symbol search, context-aware exploration. Auto-indexes repos on session start. | `uvx jcodemunch-mcp@latest` |
| [Postgres MCP](https://github.com/crystaldba/postgres-mcp) | Read-only database access via Docker. Runs with `--access-mode=restricted` and `lazy` lifecycle. | `crystaldba/postgres-mcp` |
| [chrome-devtools](https://github.com/nicobailon/chrome-devtools-mcp) | Browser automation via Chrome DevTools Protocol. | `npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest` |
| [pi-mcp-adapter](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-mcp-adapter) | Improves MCP tool response display in Pi (collapsible output). Installed as a pi package, not an MCP server. | `pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter` |

See [dotfiles/SETUP.md](dotfiles/SETUP.md) for configuration details and
safety patterns.

## How to use this

### Option 1: Just the packages

Install packages directly without cloning:

```bash
pi install npm:@danchamorro/pi-agent-modes
pi install npm:@danchamorro/pi-prompt-enhancer
```

### Option 2: Full setup

Clone and run the installer to get everything (extensions, skills, configs,
MCP templates, safety guardrails):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danchamorro/pi-toolkit.git
cd pi-toolkit/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

The installer:

1. Symlinks extensions, configs, and bundled skills
2. Installs 23 external skills via `npx skills add`
3. Creates `auth.json` and `mcp.json` from templates (fill in your keys)
4. Runs `npm install` for extensions with dependencies
5. Installs the two npm packages

To update after a pull: `./install.sh --update`

If you fork this repo as your own setup, use `./install.sh --sync` to
absorb new extensions or skills you built in pi back into the repo.

See [dotfiles/SETUP.md](dotfiles/SETUP.md) for the full walkthrough.

### Option 3: Cherry-pick

Browse [`dotfiles/`](dotfiles/) and grab what you want:

- Copy individual `.ts` extension files into `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`
- Copy skill directories into `~/.pi/agent/skills/` or `~/.agents/skills/`
- Use the external skill install commands from
  [dotfiles/README.md](dotfiles/README.md)
- Read the config files for patterns to adapt to your own setup

See [dotfiles/README.md](dotfiles/README.md) for descriptions of every file.
