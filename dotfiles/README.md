# pi-toolkit dotfiles

Complete [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono) coding agent configuration:
extensions, skills, config files, and safety guardrails.

## What's in here

```
dotfiles/
  Config files ........ AGENTS.md, APPEND_SYSTEM.md, settings.json, etc.
  extensions/ ......... 20 single-file + 2 directory-based extensions
  intercepted-commands/ Python/pip shims (uv.ts dependency)
  agent-skills/ ....... Pi-specific skills  (-> ~/.pi/agent/skills/)
  global-skills/ ...... Agent-agnostic skills (-> ~/.agents/skills/)
  install.sh .......... Setup, update, and sync script
```

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for the full installation walkthrough.

### install.sh modes

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `./install.sh` | First-time setup: symlinks everything, installs external skills, creates secret templates, installs dependencies |
| `./install.sh --update` | After `git pull`: picks up new files, reinstalls external skills, skips secrets |
| `./install.sh --sync` | Finds new extensions/skills you built in pi and absorbs them into the repo (for maintainers and forks only) |

---

## Config Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `AGENTS.md` | Global agent rules: git safety, commit style, PR style, code style, path discipline, cmux integration |
| `APPEND_SYSTEM.md` | System prompt additions: reasoning quality, jCodeMunch policy, documentation lookup rules, writing style, external data preferences |
| `settings.json` | Pi settings: default provider/model, enabled models, compaction config, installed packages |
| `models.json` | Custom model/provider definitions (e.g., local MLX models via OpenAI-compatible API) |
| `agent-modes.json` | Per-mode overrides: which provider/model/thinking level to use in debug, review, etc. |
| `damage-control-rules.yaml` | Safety guardrails (see section below) |

---

## Extensions

### Internalized from mitsuhiko/agent-stuff

Forked from commit `3bf6bd3` of [mitsuhiko/agent-stuff](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/agent-stuff).
All 9 extensions are now self-contained in this repo (no upstream package reference).

| Extension | Origin | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| `btw.ts` | Forked | Fixed `getApiKey` -> `getApiKeyAndHeaders`. Added scroll support (Shift+Up/Down, PgUp/PgDn). |
| `control.ts` | Forked | Fixed `getApiKey` calls in summarization model selection and `get_summary` RPC handler. |
| `loop.ts` | Forked | Fixed `getApiKey` calls in summary model, breakout condition, and `session_before_compact` handler. |
| `context.ts` | Ported | Context management from upstream. |
| `files.ts` | Ported | File operation tools from upstream. |
| `review.ts` | Ported | Code review extension from upstream. |
| `session-breakdown.ts` | Ported | Session cost/usage breakdown from upstream. |
| `todos.ts` | Ported | File-based todo management from upstream. |
| `uv.ts` | Ported | Python/uv integration. Depends on `intercepted-commands/`. |

**Excluded from upstream** (7 files not wanted or redundant): `go-to-bed.ts`,
`whimsical.ts`, `prompt-editor.ts`, `split-fork.ts`, `answer.ts`,
`multi-edit.ts`, `notify.ts`.

### Original extensions

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `term-notify.ts` | Desktop notification on agent completion. Uses `cmux notify` + flash when in cmux, falls back to OSC 777 for Ghostty/iTerm2/WezTerm. |
| `commit-approval.ts` | Interactive commit approval workflow. Intercepts git commits for review. |
| `pr-approval.ts` | Interactive PR approval workflow. Intercepts PR creation for review. |
| `dirty-repo-guard.ts` | Warns when working in a repo with uncommitted changes. |
| `exa-enforce.ts` | Enforces Exa usage for web search instead of ad-hoc methods. |
| `exa-search-tool.ts` | Registers Exa as a search tool for the agent. |
| `qna-interactive.ts` | Interactive Q&A mode with structured question/answer flow. |
| `question-mode.ts` | Question-only mode that restricts the agent to asking questions. |
| `require-session-name-on-exit.ts` | Prompts for a session name before exiting Pi. |
| `tilldone.ts` | Task list management with progress tracking. |
| `tools.ts` | Custom tool registrations. |

### Directory-based extensions

| Extension | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `damage-control/` | Safety guardrail engine. Loads `damage-control-rules.yaml` and enforces bash command patterns, path access rules, and delete protections. Has its own `package.json` (runs `npm install`). |
| `execute-command/` | Slash command execution extension. |

---

## Safety Guardrails (Damage Control)

The `damage-control/` extension + `damage-control-rules.yaml` form a
comprehensive safety system that protects against destructive operations:

- **Bash command patterns**: Blocks or prompts for `rm -rf`, `sudo`,
  `git reset --hard`, `git push --force`, AWS/GCP/Firebase/Vercel
  destructive operations, and SQL `DROP`/`TRUNCATE`/`DELETE` without
  `WHERE`.
- **Read-only paths**: System directories, lock files, minified bundles,
  build output, `node_modules/`.
- **No-delete paths**: `.git/`, config files (`LICENSE`, `README.md`,
  `Dockerfile`, CI configs), `~/.pi/`, `~/.claude/`.
- **AWS S3 allowlist**: Only `ls` and `cp` are permitted; all other S3
  operations are blocked.

---

## MCP Servers

Configured in `mcp.json` (created from `mcp.json.template` during install).
See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed configuration instructions.

| Server | Purpose | How it runs |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| [jCodeMunch](https://github.com/jcodemunch/jcodemunch-mcp) | Code indexing, symbol search, context-aware code exploration. Automatically indexes the current repo on session start (configured in `APPEND_SYSTEM.md`). Incremental indexing keeps subsequent runs fast. | `uvx jcodemunch-mcp@latest` |
| [Postgres MCP](https://github.com/crystaldba/postgres-mcp) | Read-only database access. Runs in Docker with `--access-mode=restricted` so only SELECT queries are allowed. Uses `"lifecycle": "lazy"` so the server only starts when first used. Add multiple entries for different databases. | `docker run crystaldba/postgres-mcp` |
| [chrome-devtools](https://github.com/nicobailon/chrome-devtools-mcp) | Browser automation via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Connects to running Chrome instances for page interaction, screenshots, and debugging. | `npx chrome-devtools-mcp@latest` |

### pi-mcp-adapter

[pi-mcp-adapter](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-mcp-adapter) is not an
MCP server. It is a Pi extension that improves how MCP tool responses are
displayed in Pi (collapsible output for large results). Installed as a
Pi package:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter
```

You don't need to run these commands manually. `install.sh` handles all of
them. The commands are listed here for cherry-pickers who want individual
skills without the full setup.
