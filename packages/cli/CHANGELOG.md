Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
This project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Normalized repository metadata to npm's preferred git URL format so
  package publishes no longer emit repository auto-correction warnings.
- Added explicit `.npmignore` files to the bundled dotfiles package paths
  that participate in CLI packaging, which removes npm's gitignore fallback
  warning during `npm pack` and `npm publish`.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- Bundled a new `clean-sessions` extension that previews old, low-value
  session files, moves confirmed matches into session trash, and provides
  `/empty-session-trash` for permanent cleanup.

### Changed

- Updated the bundled system prompt additions to prefer installed CLI tools
  such as `rg`, `fd`, `sd`, `jq`, `yq`, and `gh` when available.
- Added guidance for year-specific web searches so sessions use the current
  date instead of anchoring recommendations to stale training-era years.
- Refreshed published package documentation to match the current extension
  and skill counts shipped by the toolkit.

## [0.5.8] - 2026-04-01

### Changed

- Cleaned up `status` command output: symlink target paths are now hidden
  for healthy items (only shown for dangling/missing symlinks), dates use
  relative format ("3d ago") instead of raw ISO timestamps, and untracked
  labels are shortened from "not tracked by manifest" to "untracked".

## [0.5.7] - 2026-04-01

### Added

- Bundled `1password-developer` skill for 1Password SSH agent, Environments,
  and op CLI workflows.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- Migrated btw overlay keybinding from legacy `selectCancel` to namespaced
  `tui.select.cancel`, fixing broken cancel/dismiss on Pi 0.61.0+. Falls
  back to the legacy id for backward compatibility.
- Fixed pre-existing type mismatch in btw session context seeding.

### Added

- Unit tests for btw dismiss key matching logic.

## [0.5.5] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

- Normalized repository URL in package.json.
- Aligned published package documentation across all packages.

## [0.5.4] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- Fixed documentation inconsistencies across the repo.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- Template configs (auth.json, mcp.json) are now always copied, never
  symlinked, so machine-specific secrets stay local even in link mode.

### Changed

- Renamed manifest file from `.pi-toolkit.json` to `.pi-agent-toolkit.json`.
- Added README for the npm package page.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- Status command now detects installed components via filesystem scan
  instead of relying solely on the manifest.

### Changed

- Renamed from `pi-toolkit` to `pi-agent-toolkit` across the repo and CLI.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- `pi-agent-toolkit update` command for self-updating the CLI.
- Added code-review skill to the component registry.

### Fixed

- Added control hints to the interactive multiselect prompts.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Prompts, agents, and themes as installable component categories.
- Select-all option in the interactive picker.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- `pi-agent-toolkit sync` command to absorb unmanaged extensions, skills,
  prompts, agents, and themes back into the repo.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-28

### Added

- Initial release. Interactive CLI for selective installation of extensions,
  skills, configs, and MCP server configurations.
